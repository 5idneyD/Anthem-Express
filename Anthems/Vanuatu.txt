We are, we are, we are happy to proclaim
We are, we are, we are the people of Vanuatu

God has given us this land,
We are grateful for this,
We are strong and we are free in this land,
We are all brothers!

We are, we are, we are happy to proclaim
We are, we are, we are the people of Vanuatu

Many customs of before we have,
Many customs from today,
But we are all one,
Despite our many ways!

We are, we are, we are happy to proclaim
We are, we are, we are the people of Vanuatu

We know there is plenty of work to be done,
On all our many islands,
God helps us in our work,
He is Our Father!
