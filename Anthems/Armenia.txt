Our Fatherland, free, independent,
That has for centuries lived,
Is now summoning its sons
To the free, independent Armenia.

Here is a flag for you, my brother,
That I have sewn by hand
Over the sleepless nights,
And bathed in my tears.

Look at it, tricolored,
A valuable symbol for us.
Let it shine against the enemy.
Let you, Armenia, be glorious forever.

Death is the same everywhere,
A man dies but once,
Blessed is the one that dies
For the freedom of his nation.
