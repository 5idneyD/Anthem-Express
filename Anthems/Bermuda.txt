Hail to Bermuda,
My island in the sun.
Sing out in glory
To the nation we’ve become.
We’ve grown from heart to heart,
And strength to strength,
The privilege is mine
To sing long live Bermuda,
Because this island’s mine!

Hail to Bermuda,
My homeland dear to me.
This is my own land
Built on faith
And unity.
We’ve grown from heart to heart
And strength to strength,
For Loyalty is Prime
So sing long live Bermuda,
Because this island’s mine!
