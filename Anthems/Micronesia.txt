This here we are pledging,
With heart and with hand,
Full measure of devotion
To thee, our native land.

Now all join the chorus,
Let union abide.
Across all Micronesia
Join hands on every side.

We all work together,
With hearts, voice and hand,
Till we have made these islands
Another promised land.
