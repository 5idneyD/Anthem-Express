Oh Uganda!
May God uphold Thee
We lay our future in thy hand,
United, free,
For liberty,
Together we’ll always stand.

Oh Uganda!
The land of Freedom,
Our love and labor we give,
And with neighbours’ all,
At our Country’s call,
In peace and friendship, we’ll live.

Oh Uganda!
The land that Feeds us,
By sun and fertile soil grown,
For our own dear land,
We’ll always stand,
The Pearl of Africa’s Crown.
