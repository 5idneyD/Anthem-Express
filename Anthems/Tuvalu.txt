Tuvalu mo te Atua,
Ko te Fakavae sili,
Ko te ala foki tena,
Mo te manuia katoa
Loto lasi o fai,
Tou malo saoloto
Fusi ake katoa
Ki te loto alofa
Kae amo fakatasi
Ate atu fenua.
“Tuvalu mo te Atua”
Ki te se gata mai!

Tuku atu tau pulega
Ki te pule mai luga,
Kilo tonu ki ou mua
Me ko ia e tautai.
“Pule tasi mo ia”
Ki te se gata mai,
Ko tena mana
Ko tou malosi tena.
Pati lima kae kalaga
Ulufonu ki te tupu.
“Tuvalu ko tu saoloto”
Ki te se gata mai!


Tuvalu for the Almighty
Are the words we hold most dear
For as people or as leaders
Of Tuvalu we all share
In the knowledge that God
Ever rules in heav’n above,
And that we in this land
Are united in His love.
We build on a sure foundation
When we trust in God’s great law
“Tuvalu for the Almighty”
Be our song for evermore!

Let us trust our lives henceforward
To the King to whom we pray,
With our eyes fixed firmly on Him
He is showing us the way.
“May we reign with Him in glory”
Be our song for evermore,
for His almighty power
Is our strength from shore to shore.
Shout aloud in jubilation
To the King whom we adore.
“Tuvalu free and united”
Be our song for evermore!
