Mlungu dalitsani Malaŵi,
Mumsunge m’mtendere.
Gonjetsani adani onse,
Njala, nthenda, nsanje.
Lunzitsani mitima yathu,
Kuti tisaope.
Mdalitse Mtsogoleri nafe,
Ndi Mayi Malaŵi.

Malaŵi ndziko lokongola,
La chonde ndi ufulu,
Nyanja ndi mphepo ya m’mapiri,
Ndithudi tadala.
Zigwa, mapiri, nthaka, dzinthu,
N’mphatso zaulere.
Nkhalango, madambo abwino.
Ngwokoma Malaŵi.

O Ufulu tigwirizane,
Kukweza Malaŵi.
Ndi chikondi, khama, kumvera,
Timutumikire.
Pa nkhondo nkana pa mtendere,
Cholinga n’chimodzi.
Mayi, bambo, tidzipereke,
Pokweza Malaŵi.


O God bless our land of Malaŵi,
Keep it a land of peace.
Put down each and every enemy,
Hunger, disease, envy.
Join together all our hearts as one,
That we be free from fear.
Bless our leader, each and every one,
And Mother Malaŵi.

Our own Malaŵi, this land so fair,
Fertile and brave and free.
With its lakes, refreshing mountain air,
How greatly blest are we.
Hills and valleys, soil so rich and rare
Give us a bounty free.
Wood and forest, plains so broad and fair,
All – beauteous Malaŵi.

Freedom ever, let us all unite
To build up Malaŵi.
With our love, our zeal and loyalty,
Bringing our best to her.
In time of war, or in time of peace,
One purpose and one goal.
Men and women serving selflessly
In building Malaŵi.
