Lesotho fatshe la bo-ntata rona;
Hara mafatshe ohle le letle ke lona;
Ke moo re hlahileng,
Ke moo re holileng,
Rea le rata.

Molimo aku boloke Lesotho
U felise lintoa le matsoenyeho;
Oho fatse lena;
La bo-ntata rona;
Le be le khotso.


Lesotho, land of our Fathers,
Among the lands it is the most beautiful.
It is where we were born,
It is where we grew up–
We love it.

God, please protect Lesotho.
Spare it conflict, and tribulation–
Oh, this land,
Land of our Fathers,
May it have the peace.
