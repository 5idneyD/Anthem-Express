Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahamaland;
March on to glory your bright banners waving high.

See how the world marks the manner of your bearing!
Pledge to excel through love and unity.

Pressing onward, march together to a common loftier goal;
Steady sunward, tho’ the weather hide the wide and treachrous shoal.

Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahamaland,
‘Til the road you’ve trod lead unto your God,

March On, Bahamaland.
