ʻE ʻotua māfimafi
Ko homau ʻeiki koe
Ko koe ko e falalaʻanga
Mo e ‘ofa ki Tonga;

ʻAfio hifo ʻemau lotu
ʻA ia ʻoku mau faí ni
Mo ke tali homau loto
ʻO maluʻi ʻa Tupou.


Oh almighty God above
Thou art our lord and sure defense
As your people, we trust thee
And our Tonga thou dost love

Hear our prayer for thou unseen
We know that thou hath blessed our land
Grant our earnest supplication
Guard and save Tupou, our king.
