Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are one and free ;
We’ve golden soil 
and wealth for toil,
Our home is girt by sea ;
Our land abounds in Nature’s gifts
Of beauty rich and rare ;
In history’s page, let every stage
Advance Australia fair !
In joyful strains then let us sing,
« Advance Australia fair ! »

Beneath our radiant southern Cross,
We’ll toil with hearts and hands ;
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands ;
For those who’ve come across the seas
We’ve boundless plains to share ;
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
« Advance Australia fair ! »
