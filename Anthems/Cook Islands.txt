I tō mātou nei reo
Tē kāpiki atu nei.

I a mātou nei
‘Omai te korona mou
Kia ngāteitei
Kia vai rāi te aro’a
O te pā ‘enua ē.
O te pā ‘enua ē.

as we call to you.

Protect and guide us
and give us your crown of truth
so we can be successful
and so that love 
and peace will rule forever
over our beloved country,
