O Fhlùir na h-Alba,
cuin a chì sinn
an seòrsa laoich
a sheas gu bàs ‘son
am bileag feòir is fraoich,
a sheas an aghaidh
feachd uailleil Iomhair
‘s a ruaig e dhachaidh
air chaochladh smaoin.

Na cnuic tha lomnochd
‘s tha duilleach Foghair
mar bhrat air làr,
am fearann caillte
dan tug na seòid ud gràdh,
a sheas an aghaidh
feachd uailleil Iomhair
‘s a ruaig e dhachaigh
air chaochladh smaoin.

Tha ‘n eachdraidh dùinte
ach air dìochuimhne
chan fheum i bhith,
is faodaidh sinn èirigh
gu bhith nar Rìoghachd a-rìs
a sheas an aghaidh
feachd uailleil Iomhair
‘s a ruaig e dhachaidh
air chaochladh smaoin.

O Flouer o Scotland,
Whan will we see
Your like again,
That focht and dee’d for,
Your wee bit Hill an Glen,
An stuid agin him,
Prood Edward’s Airmy,
An sent him hamewart,
Tae think again.

The Hills is bare nou,
An Autumn leafs
Lies thick an still,
Ower land that is lost nou,
That thae sae dearly held,
That stuid agin him,
Prood Edward’s Airmy,
An sent him hamewart,
Tae think again.

Thir days is past nou,
An in the past
They maun remain,
But we can aye rise nou,
An be the nation again,
That stuid agin him,
Prood Edward’s Airmy,
An sent him hamewart,
Tae think again.

O Flower of Scotland
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for
Your wee bit hill and glen,
And stood against him
Proud Edward’s Army
And sent him homeward
Tae think again.

The hills are bare now
And autumn leaves
Lie thick and still
O’er land that is lost now,
Which those so dearly held,
That stood against him
Proud Edward’s Army
And sent him homeward
Tae think again.

Those days are past now
And in the past
They must remain
But we can still rise now,
And be the Nation again
That stood against him
Proud Edward’s army
And sent him homeward
Tae think again.

When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for
Your wee bit hill and glen,
And stood against him,
Proud Edward’s Army
And sent him homeward
