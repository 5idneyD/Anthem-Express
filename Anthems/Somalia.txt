Qolobaa calankeedu,
waa ceynoo,
Innaga keenu waa

Cirkoo kale ee,
aan caadna lahaynoo,
Ee caashaqa ee.

Xidigyahay caddi waad,
Naa ciidamisee,
Carradaa kaligaa

aadiga u curad ee
cadceeda sideeda
la caan noqo eey

Cishadaad dhalataad calooshaydii
Sidii culaygii cidaad marisee
ha ku celin cawoy dhahe ee


Any nationâ€™s flag, bears its own color
The sky above us, does ours look like
Defects it has none; love it with candor

Oh you White Star, at your service we are
Superior you are, in any part of our land
Be famous oh Star, like the sun of the far

On the day you arose, our hearts you have
Purified with pureness, Oh you our flag
Lord may not dim you, pray we in this night

The detached part of, our forces of five
I beseech from God, their return you cause
This fate that wrote, for us to meet now
